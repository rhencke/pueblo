Pueblo collects usage statistics so we can serve you better.
Specifically, Pueblo tracks the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What worlds you connect to.
<li>The time that you connect to a world.
<li>The time that you disconnect from a world.
<li>The version of the Pueblo/UE client you are using.
</ul>
<p>
That's it.  We protect your privacy.  Pueblo does not log your
MUD account ids or anything else you type into a MUD.
</p>
<p>
We do not store any information that can be traced to you
personally or to your computer.  There is also no way to
associate your registration details with the worlds you
connect to.  We will never sell or give away your personal
details -- we hate spam just as much as you do!
