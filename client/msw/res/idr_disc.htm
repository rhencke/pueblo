			Pueblo collects usage statistics so we can serve you better. Specifically, 
			Pueblo tracks the following things:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			What worlds you connect to.
			<li>
			The time that you connect to a world.
			<li>
			The time that you disconnect from a world.
			<li>
			The version of the Pueblo/UE client you are using.
		</ul>
		<p>
			That's it. We protect your privacy. Pueblo does not log your MUD account ids or 
			anything else you type into a MUD.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not store any information that can be traced to you personally or to your 
			computer. There is also no way to associate your registration details with the 
			worlds you connect to. We will never sell or give away your personal details -- 
			we hate spam just as much as you do!
		</p>
		<h3>Communications</h3>
		<p>
			You should be aware that world connections are almost always Telnet-based, 
			which by its nature involves all communications being sent as plain text 
			(without any encryption). This means that it is possible for third parties to 
			snoop on your activities, and could even obtain your login id and password, 
			since they are also sent in the clear. As stated above, we don't do this 
			ourselves, but due to the nature of the Internet and its protocols we can't 
			guarantee that you are secure -- and don't forget that other people connected 
			to the world may be logging what you say when you're near them as a matter of 
			course. So be careful with those trade secrets! <tt>;-)</tt>
		</p>
		<h3>Passwords</h3>
		<p>
			If you elect to use Pueblo's automatic login feature, you should be aware that 
			while Pueblo encrypts your password before saving it into the Personal World 
			List (to discourage casual hackers), it is by no means a particularly secure 
			algorithm (especially since the open-source nature of Pueblo makes the 
			encryption and decryption routines publically accessible), and as noted above 
			the password will be transmitted unencrypted to the world server. As with any 
			other password, if you are worried about security you should change your 
			passwords frequently.
