			<h1>Pueblo/UE Prerelease License Agreement</h1>
		</center>
		<p>You are using a prerelease version of Pueblo/UE.&nbsp; Please note the 
			following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you compiled this version yourself from source code, remember that the <b>Andromedia 
					Public License</b> (which you can find at <tt>http://pueblo.sf.net/APL/</tt>) 
				applies.<br>
			<li>
				If you downloaded this version from the official Pueblo/UE website (<tt>http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/</tt>), 
				then remember that as this isn't an actual release version, it may contain 
				bugs, incompatibilities, and just plain general weirdness (which isn't to say 
				that the actual releases are better -- prerelease versions contain extra 
				features and sometimes bugfixes, so occasionally the reverse is actually 
				true!).&nbsp; Basically, your mileage may vary, and there are no 
				guarantees&nbsp;-- though don't worry, a full release version should be along 
				eventually....&nbsp; Oh, and please don't distribute prerelease versions to 
				other people; just point them at the actual release versions!<br>
			<li>
				If you downloaded this version from some other website, either somebody ignored 
				the request in the previous paragraph, or they've compiled up their own 
				modified version without editing the appropriate notices.&nbsp; In either case, 
				they're naughty, and you should tell them off!&nbsp; <tt>:-)</tt></li>
