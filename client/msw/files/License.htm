      <h1>Pueblo/UE License Agreement</h1>
    </center>
    This is the license agreement you must sign when you first run Pueblo/UE.
    If you wish to review this agreement later, you will find it in the <font
    color="#800000"><tt>license.htm</tt></font> file in the main Pueblo/UE
    directory. 

    <p><b><font color="#800000">Read this document carefully.</font> If you
    press the ACCEPT button, you become a party to this agreement and agree to
    be bound by its terms. If you press the REJECT button, you decline the
    agreement and must not use the software.</b></p>

    <p>I got a little bored and irritated at all the lawyer-speak in the
    previous versions of this license (since it was based on the original
    Pueblo 2.01 license); so I've completely rewritten it to use a more human
    language. Appropriate legalese translations still apply.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>This is free software. As such, you get what you pay for -- you
      cannot claim support or damages for <b>any</b> reason. Nobody who has
      worked on the Pueblo or Pueblo/UE code provides any warranties or can be
      held liable for anything, not even that implied stuff that lawyers
      always rant about. Live with it.</li>

      <li>If you can't live with it, don't use the software. It's that simple.
      But if you do want to fight about it, you have to do so in New Zealand
      and subject to New Zealand law.</li>

      <li>If (and only if) you accept this agreement, you are free to use this
      version of Pueblo/UE, and give it to all your friends (and even your
      enemies), provided that they also abide by this agreement.</li>

      <li>Ultra Enterprises (UE) can modify anything they like (including the
      terms of the license) in later versions of Pueblo/UE. If you don't like
      the new terms or functionality, you are free to continue using your old
      version under its original license. Don't expect any sympathy
      though.</li>

      <li>Pueblo/UE is a client, and so lets you view images and other content
      created by other people. All that stuff belongs to whoever created it;
      just because you can see it doesn't mean you have a license to do stuff
      with it. You cannot rip off other people's images or publish their words
      (to name a couple of nonexclusive examples) without their express
      consent.</li>

      <li>Pueblo/UE is an open-source product, and so you may obtain the
      source code and create your own versions of Pueblo or derivative works,
      provided that you abide by the terms of the Andromedia Public License
      ("APL"). The binary license (the one you are reading right now) is not
      applicable to the source-code version of Pueblo/UE, so you may do so
      even if you reject the terms of this license (but you still have to
      abide by the APL).</li>

      <li>This is a license to <b>use</b> the software; you do not own the
      software or its associated intellectual property rights. All title and
      rights remain with the authors of the respective components of the
      software, except to the limited extent outlined above.</li>

      <li>Neither Ultra Enterprises nor Gavin Lambert is a lawyer, or have
      consulted lawyers, as should be obvious by the plain English used
      throughout this license agreement. In the event that any part of this
      agreement is deemed unlawful or otherwise unenforcable, its expressed
      intent shall be held up to the maximum extent permissable by law. In the
      event its expressed intent cannot be determined, it is subject to
      clarification only by Gavin Lambert.</li>

      <li>Pueblo/UE does collect and "phone home" information that some people
      may consider private. However UE guarantees that the official releases
      of Pueblo/UE will never retain personally-identifiable information. The
      client has no "unique id" or other mechanism to keep track of individual
      users or computers. More information can be found in the "Privacy" tab
      of the "About Pueblo" dialog. This guarantee applies only to the official
      UE release; customised or altered versions based on the Pueblo source code
      are not covered by this guarantee.</li>

      <li>That's it. Any promise, warranty, or condition not explicitly
      mentioned in this agreement is not binding on either party, unless in
      written form and signed by both the user and Gavin Lambert.</li>
